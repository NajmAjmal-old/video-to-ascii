# Video to ASCII Art Converter

Convert videos into colorful ASCII art for terminal display using Python and OpenCV.

## Description

This project provides a Python script that takes a video file as input and converts each frame of the video into ASCII art. The resulting ASCII art frames are displayed in the terminal, creating a unique visual experience. The conversion is achieved by mapping pixel colors to corresponding characters from a predefined character set.

## Features

- Convert video frames into colorful ASCII art.
- Customizable character set and color mapping.
- Automatic resizing of frames to fit terminal dimensions.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   python3 -m pip install numpy opencv-python
   ```

2. Run the script with a video file as an argument:
   ```
   python3 main.py path_to_video.mp4
   ```
